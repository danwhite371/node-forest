- [ ] Adding documentation. [60, 40]
- [ ] Spell check docs.
      We want to keep track of task time and what changes go with what version.
- [ ] Create home page. [30]
      Title bar, Name login (user icon with dropdown for login, logout)
      at some point this is going to be a forum, so people should be able to see a view only.
      We have small notes with limited text length. But each note can have children and a note can contain a list or a tree of other notes. This will be used for styling and each tree level is a heading. Notes in a tree or list are called sub notes.
- [ ] Document process. Look at some open source project and take notes and versioning, readme.md, change.log, todo, bugs, that sort of thing.
- [ ] Enable dark mode toggle
- [ ] Create login page
- [ ] Use custom router, which has a current location and a set location
